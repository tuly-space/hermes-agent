"""Prescreen-flip silent blackout (SPEC C7 FIX 1) regression tests.

Flipping ``LCM_EMBEDDING_BINARY_PRESCREEN`` on an already-populated float32
identity used to make ``_has_binary()`` true after ONE sign-bit row, routing
the whole identity onto the two-stage path whose INNER JOIN against
``lcm_embedding_binary`` silently excluded every pre-flip vector while still
reporting ``coverage='full'``. These assert the two guarantees the fix adds:

  (a) flipping the flag mints a NEW identity (a fresh, backfill-trackable
      corpus) rather than mutating the populated one in place -- the active
      identity honestly reports its own contents ('none' when fresh, never a
      dishonest 'full' hiding the pre-flip corpus); and
  (b) defense-in-depth: an identity whose binary corpus is only PARTIAL never
      takes the two-stage INNER-JOIN path (which would exclude the binary-less
      vectors); it falls back to the exact scan so every vector is scored.
