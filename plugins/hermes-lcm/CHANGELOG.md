## Unreleased

## v0.20.0 - 2026-07-23

Release focus: Lossless-Claw parity plus the merged cross-session recall and temporal retrieval stack.

- Completed the five selected Lossless-Claw parity behaviors: recoverable active-replay stubs for large externalized tool results; token-bounded fresh tails that preserve the newest message and complete tool-call/result groups; dry-run-first historical tool-output backfill with guarded rollback; bounded active-session externalized-payload search with strict ownership and recoverability checks; and bounded atomic threshold full sweeps with one final active-context publication. (#380, #381, #382, #413)
- Shipped the merged #413 recall and temporal surface: `lcm_recall`, `lcm_recent`, and `lcm_load_session`; semantic and hybrid retrieval over summaries and message chunks; temporal rollups with bounded fallback; optional proactive recall; and the corresponding benchmark and reproduction documentation.
- Release boundary: stock installs keep large-output externalization, active-replay stubbing, embeddings, temporal rollups, proactive recall, and threshold full sweeps disabled by default. Payload search requires explicit `content_scope`; historical backfill remains an operator-invoked, dry-run-first command. Committed benchmark results are directional evidence under their documented model and harness, not a universal provider-parity claim. This release does not include the later work tracked in #423, #434, or #436.

## v0.19.0 - 2026-07-07

Release focus: data-safety hardening, operator diagnostics, import tooling, benchmarking, and the WS5 engine decomposition.

- Hardened lossless storage and replay boundaries: GC tombstones preserve surrounding text, ingest failures surface in status/doctor, ignored-message drops are counted, persisted Hermes tool outputs and redacted durable retries replay losslessly, and auxiliary bypass/session fallback edge cases are covered. (#298, #308, #310, #312, #313)
- Strengthened storage and downgrade safety with serialized lifecycle/DAG writes, monotonic frontiers, path-contained externalized payloads, ReDoS-safe redaction, wrapped-base64 handling, a summary spend guard, and a schema-too-new open guard. (#300, #301, #302)
- Added operator and migration surfaces: read-only `lcm_inspect`, JSONL session export import, compression no-op status, compaction telemetry, benchmark-backed preset validation, and steady-state hot-path benchmarks. (#295, #303, #306, #307, #309, #320)
- Added CI-backed ruff linting and release/validation-friendly tooling updates, including follow-up JSONL import hardening and metadata JSON access through `MessageStore`. (#314, #315, #316)
- Began and documented the behaviour-preserving WS5 decomposition of the ~9k-line `engine.py`: stateful method clusters became `*Mixin` classes (`compaction.py`, `reconcile.py`, `aux_session.py`, `placeholder_ledger.py`) mixed back into `LCMEngine`, and pure/helper groups became plain modules (`engine_registry.py`, `codex_routing.py`, `sqlite_util.py`, `runtime_identity.py`, `message_analysis.py`). (#323, #324, #325, #326, #327, #328, #329, #330, #331, #332, #333, #334, #335, #336, #337, #338, #339)

## v0.18.1 - 2026-06-30

Release focus: compaction privacy, clone/hook integrity, doctor signal accuracy, and model-context safety.

- Excluded ignored backlog and stripped injected context before compaction, preventing ignored or synthetic context from entering LCM summaries. (#283, #282)
- Preserved Discord lane metadata, active LCM clone resolution, and context metadata through cloned engines and post hooks. (#292, #293, #289)
- Hardened runtime identity, raw tool call integrity refs, payload integrity checks, and doctor path/lifecycle diagnostics. (#281, #278, #279, #291, #273, #280)
- Updated Codex OAuth effective context window safety defaults. (#274, #276)
- Completed focus-topic demotion behavior and preserved raw session ownership across compression rollover. (#268, #269)
- Refreshed operator docs, community-health files, and release-validation guidance. (#272)

## v0.18.0 - 2026-06-18

Release focus: retrieval depth, durability, status provenance, and long-session correctness.

- Added recursive evidence support for `lcm_expand_query`, improving synthesized answers from expanded LCM context. (#266)
- Hardened externalized payload durability. (#265)
- Avoided duplicate ingest protection work on hot paths. (#262)
- Aggregated DAG status stats for cheaper health surfaces. (#264)
- Preserved source lineage after long sessions. (#263)
- Surfaced LCM config provenance in runtime status. (#261)
- Fixed per-turn ingest for WebUI sessions and batch timestamp deduplication. (#260)

## v0.17.0 - 2026-06-14

Release focus: automatic focus-topic derivation and lifecycle hygiene.

- Added auto-derived focus topics during compression.
- Added empty lifecycle-row garbage collection to prevent unbounded accumulation. (#256)
- Improved runtime context indicators.

## v0.16.x - 2026-06

Release focus: engine isolation, WAL durability, database-path clarity, and startup cost control.

- Isolated LCM engine state per agent. (#247)
- Preferred bound sessions on sibling chains when the host has zero DAG.
- Tuned compaction defaults and clarified context-threshold ownership. (#245)
- Clarified `LCM_DATABASE_PATH` override behavior. (#249)
- Hardened WAL durability and graceful-close checkpoints. (#237)
- Throttled startup FTS integrity checks to reduce launch time. (#236)
