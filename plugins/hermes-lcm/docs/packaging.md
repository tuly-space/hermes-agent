# Packaging and distribution posture

## Current decision

`hermes-lcm` intentionally remains a clone-or-symlink Hermes user plugin for now. The supported install path is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stephenschoettler/hermes-lcm \
  ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-lcm
```

For profile-specific installs, clone under `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/plugins/hermes-lcm`. For development checkouts, `scripts/install.sh` creates a profile-aware symlink into the active Hermes plugin directory and refuses to overwrite an existing checkout or unrelated symlink.

## Why not pip-style packaging yet?

The repository is a Hermes plugin, not a standalone Python application. Runtime discovery currently depends on:

- `plugin.yaml` declaring the plugin name and registered tools
- the repo root containing `__init__.py` for Hermes plugin registration
- the operator placing or symlinking the checkout into Hermes' plugin search path
- no required third-party runtime dependencies beyond Python 3.11+ and optional accelerators such as `tiktoken` and `regex`

There is no `pyproject.toml` or package metadata today, and that is deliberate until Hermes plugin packaging/discovery has a stable target for pip-installed plugins. Adding generic Python packaging before the host install contract is clear would create a second install story without making first-run activation simpler.

## Next packaging step

Make packaging a separate implementation lane only when one of these is true:

1. Hermes Agent documents a stable pip/distribution entrypoint for plugins.
2. Users need version-pinned installs without direct git checkouts.
3. Release automation needs packaged artifacts beyond GitHub tags/releases.

The narrow next step would be packaging metadata plus tests that prove a packaged install still exposes `hermes-lcm`, context engine `lcm`, and all ten LCM tools through `hermes plugins`. Until then, clone/symlink remains the documented path.
